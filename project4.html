        In order to create the homographies and mosaics, we need to calculate the homography matrix \( \mathbf{H} \), which is defined as:

    </div>

        <h2>2. Structure of Homography Matrix (note the scaling factor h_{33} = 1)\( \mathbf{H} \)</h2>

        <h2>3. Linear System for Estimating \( \mathbf{H} \)</h2>
        <p>Given corresponding points \( (x, y) \) and \( (x', y') \), the following equations are formed:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            x' &= \frac{h_{11}x + h_{12}y + h_{13}}{h_{31}x + h_{32}y + 1} \\
            y' &= \frac{h_{21}x + h_{22}y + h_{23}}{h_{31}x + h_{32}y + 1}
            \end{aligned}
            \]

    </div>

    <div class="equation-container">
        <h2>4. Matrix Formulation for Multiple Points</h2>
        <p>The system can be linearized as:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \mathbf{A} \mathbf{h} = 0
            \]
        </p>
        <p>where \( \mathbf{A} \) is the design matrix and \( \mathbf{h} \) is a vector of the elements of \( \mathbf{H} \).</p>

        <p>The design matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) for a set of corresponding points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_1', y_1') \) is constructed as follows:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
            x_1 & y_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1 x_1' & -y_1 x_1' \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 & -x_1 y_1' & -y_1 y_1'
            \end{bmatrix}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            Each pair of corresponding points contributes two rows to the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \). For additional point correspondences, the same pattern repeats, adding new rows to \( \mathbf{A} \). The system is then solved for the vector \( \mathbf{h} \), which contains the elements \( h_{11}, h_{12}, h_{13}, h_{21}, h_{22}, h_{23}, h_{31}, h_{32} \).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="equation-container">
        <h2>5. Using More Points and Least Squares</h2>
        <p>
            Although four points are sufficient to estimate the homography matrix \( \mathbf{H} \), using more than four points improves accuracy. By including additional point correspondences, we create an overdetermined system, which can be solved using the least squares method. The least squares approach minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual point correspondences, yielding a more robust estimate of \( \mathbf{H} \) that accounts for noise and small variations in the data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="equation-container">
    <h2>6. Image Warping</h2>
    <p>
        Image warping is a key step in creating mosaics, where the goal is to transform one image to align with another using the homography matrix \( \mathbf{H} \). Once we have calculated the homography matrix, we apply it to map the points in the source image to the corresponding points in the target image.
    </p>
    <p>
        To warp an image, for each pixel \( (x', y') \) in the target image, we calculate the corresponding point \( (x, y) \) in the source image using the inverse of the homography transformation:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        s \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} =
        \mathbf{H}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, \( \mathbf{H}^{-1} \) is the inverse of the homography matrix, and the resulting point \( (x, y) \) is mapped back into the original image.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the result of this transformation may not lie exactly on an integer pixel, interpolation is used to estimate the pixel intensity at fractional coordinates. Common interpolation methods include nearest-neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic interpolation. This ensures that the warped image retains high-quality visual features.
    </p>

    <p>
        The warping process is repeated for every pixel in the target image, transforming the entire source image to align with the desired view. This enables smooth blending and accurate alignment between images in the final mosaic.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="equation-container">
    <h2>7. Bounding Box of the Warped Image</h2>
    <p>
        After warping an image using the homography matrix \( \mathbf{H} \), the transformed image might not align neatly within the original image boundaries. To ensure that the entire warped image is visible, we compute the bounding box of the transformed image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bounding box is determined by applying the homography transformation to the four corners of the source image. The corners of an image at coordinates \( (0, 0), (w, 0), (w, h), (0, h) \) (where \( w \) and \( h \) are the width and height of the source image, respectively) are warped using the homography matrix:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{H} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the new positions of the four corners are calculated, the minimum and maximum \( x' \) and \( y' \) values provide the extents of the bounding box. This defines the size of the canvas required to display the entire warped image without cropping.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to adjust the image translation so that the warped image fits within the computed bounding box. This may involve shifting the image if negative coordinates are present.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="equation-container">
    <h2>8. Alpha Blending</h2>
    <p>
        When stitching multiple warped images together into a mosaic, alpha blending is used to smooth the transitions between overlapping images. This technique blends the pixel intensities of the overlapping regions, resulting in a seamless transition between images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alpha blending works by assigning each pixel a blending factor, or alpha value, which determines how much of each image contributes to the final pixel value in the mosaic. The alpha value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). In overlapping regions, pixels are a weighted combination of the overlapping images:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
        I_{\text{final}}(x, y) = \alpha I_1(x, y) + (1 - \alpha) I_2(x, y)
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, \( I_1(x, y) \) and \( I_2(x, y) \) are the pixel values from the two overlapping images, and \( \alpha \) is the blending factor.
    </p>
    <p>
        A common approach is to gradually vary the alpha values across the overlapping region, so that the transition between images is smooth. Linear or Gaussian blending can be applied based on the distance from the edges of the overlapping area. This reduces visible seams and artifacts, producing a more natural-looking mosaic.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using alpha blending, we ensure that images with different lighting, exposure, or minor alignment errors still combine seamlessly in the final mosaic.
